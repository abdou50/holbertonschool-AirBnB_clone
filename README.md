# AirBnB
* hello my name is abdelkaderraddai today as a colaboration between me and my friend achref we created our airbnb console that is like the reel airbnb platform
Let’s look at a airbnb from the top down
# How does the airbnb work
You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
#  the real AIRBNB
A community based on sharing
Airbnb was born in 2008, when two designers with a spare bedroom welcomed three travelers who were looking for a place to sleep. Today, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account to post their listing or book unique places around the world. And Airbnb Experience Hosts share their passions and interests with travelers and locals.

# CMD
The commands module contains utility functions for working with shell command output under Unix. This module is made obsolete by the subprocess module. There are 3 functions in the commands module for working with external commands. The functions are shell-aware and return the output or status code from the command.
# OOP
OOP is one of the most fundamental programming concepts. Let’s explore the four main OOP concepts in python and discuss how each works.

python is one of many programming languages and technologies supported by Netreo’s leading tools, Retrace and Prefix. At Netreo, we aim to help developers become better. Let’s take a look at some of the foundational Java programming language concepts with a primer on OOP concepts in python
